# Lab 08 - Total Em Up

## Instructions
Write a program that will total up all of the values in an array.  Try using a foreach loop since you don't need to know the position of any item.

1. Complete the `total()` method so that it returns the sum of all of the items in the array passed to it.
2. Create some arrays in your main method to test your method.
3. Don't forget to Commit and Push to save your code.
